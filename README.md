# CSS-Grid-demonstration
Demonstrating how grid works with a code-along in context of the "Typo Landingpage" assignment for WU09. 

There are 2 branches as their has been 2 different versions of this code. The `main` branch is the first version used for demonstrating how CSS grid could be used in the assignment and the `typo-idela-layout` branch showcases a possible solution to the assignments with inspiration from BEM and SMACCS conventions as well as an extra thought to accesability in the structure of the HTML.
