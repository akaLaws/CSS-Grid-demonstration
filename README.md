# CSS-Grid-demonstration
This code was used to illustrate CSS modulation (inspired by SMACSS) and CSS Grid i relation to an assignment coding a landingpage using CSS grid and pseudo selectors. 

The purpose of the code was to be a live demonstration with input from the students. The session was recorded on video made availbale on the students teams channel. 

There are 2 branches as their has been 2 different versions of this code. The `main` branch is the first version used for demonstrating how CSS grid could be used in the assignment and the `typo-idela-layout` branch showcases a possible solution to the assignments with inspiration from BEM and SMACCS conventions as well as an extra thought to accesability in the structure of the HTML.
