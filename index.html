            My big concern here whas where the sectiosn was too small. My argument for keeping them as is, is that they layout wise
            Looks like seperate sections and in regard to the readers only chrome readers like TalkBack treats it as a landmark witth a "region" as prase
            Considering this I would provide an Aria-Label to the sections as they convey important information as time and place respectably.
            
            This also corresponds to how you would read the text as information on the event intuitively. 
            However I would argue for the content to switch and the subject be at the first section for more intuitive reading in regard to placement of heading.
            But this is still a layout and not a content assignment...
